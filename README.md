# Twenty-Questions
As the name suggests,it's the game Twenty Questions.
This program uses a binary tree composed of linked nodes. 
Each non-leaf node contains a yes/no question and a left/right node for each respective answer.
The game gets better the more you play because whenever the user reaches a leaf node, they are
prompted to enter a new question that differentiates their answer from the game's guess to be saved permanently into the tree
